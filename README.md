This is a training project and this is used for consolidating programming concepts or technologies.

Projects that I can show off are in the "pinned" tab on my profile.

This project clarifies me a "Lifting State Up" concept that I previously knew and used unconsciously but I didn't associate it when I got this question during a job interview.

TL;DR
In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called “lifting state up”.
